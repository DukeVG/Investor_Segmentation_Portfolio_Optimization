## **Features**

### **1. Data Simulation and Preprocessing**
- Generated realistic investor data, including demographics, risk tolerance, and portfolio metrics.
- Cleaned and normalized datasets for consistency.
- Created advanced features such as risk-adjusted returns and asset allocation diversity scores.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized investor segmentation by demographics and investment types.
- Analyzed key metrics like returns vs. risk tolerance and liquidity preferences.
