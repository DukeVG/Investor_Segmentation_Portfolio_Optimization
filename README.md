# Investor Insights and Portfolio Optimization

## **Overview**
This project aims to empower alternative fund managers to better engage with retail, HNW, and UHNW investors by leveraging data-driven insights. Through advanced analytics and interactive dashboards, it provides actionable recommendations for optimizing investment offerings, ensuring transparency, and managing liquidity efficiently.

## **Features**

### **1. Data Simulation and Preprocessing**
- Generated realistic investor data, including demographics, risk tolerance, and portfolio metrics.
- Cleaned and normalized datasets for consistency.
- Created advanced features such as risk-adjusted returns and asset allocation diversity scores.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized investor segmentation by demographics and investment types.
- Analyzed key metrics like returns vs. risk tolerance and liquidity preferences.

### **3. Clustering and Segmentation**
- Applied clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify distinct investor profiles.
- Provided tailored investment recommendations for each segment.

### **4. Predictive Analytics**
- Built machine learning models to predict investor preferences and forecast portfolio performance.
- Utilized algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

### **5. Portfolio Optimization**
- Leveraged Markowitz Portfolio Theory to suggest optimal asset allocations.
- Balanced returns with liquidity and risk for various investor segments.

### **6. Interactive Dashboard**
- Designed using Python Dash and Plotly for:
  - Real-time segmentation insights.
  - Personalized investment recommendations.
  - Monitoring portfolio performance and liquidity.

## **Results and Insights**
- Identified three distinct investor profiles:
  1. Risk-tolerant young professionals.
  2. Balanced mid-career individuals.
  3. Conservative UHNW retirees.
- Predictive models achieved over 85% accuracy in forecasting preferences.
- Portfolio optimization enhanced returns by ~12% while reducing risk by ~8%.
